# Staffpad
A cross-platform, music composition app

## What is Staffpad?

Staffpad is, in essence, simply an app where one can compose music. The target use cases vary from composers making quick, on the fly compositions, 
or students learning music reading to hear how an excerpt sounds. The interface is designed to be simple, and similar to the staff
on paper.

## Running instructions:

This app is based off of the Ionic framework, specifically, Ionic v2.

To run the app locally in the browser, start off by installing the dependencies with npm:

    $ npm install -g cordova ionic

Once that succeeds, you're good to clone the repo, and cd into it.

    $ git clone https://github.com/pattyjogal/Staffpad.git && cd Staffpad
    
And start the local server with

    $ ionic serve
    
An address should pop up, like `localhost:8100`. You can visit it from your browser to see the app! That's it!
